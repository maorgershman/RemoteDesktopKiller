# RemoteDesktopKiller
A lightweight C Win32 program that disables remote desktop connection to your computer by DameWare and Configuration Manager.  

# How does it work?
It just waits for `DWRCS.exe` or `CmRcService.exe` to spawn and immediatly terminates them.  

# Why would I need this shit?
Good question.  
I once got trolled by some admins in a network.  
They connected to my computer, locked my mouse & keyboard and started trolling me, so this is my revenge.
